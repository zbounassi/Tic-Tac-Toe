The version of Tic-Tac-Toe has begun as a self project for playing Tic-Tac-Toe against the CPU on three different difficulties, also allowing play between 2 players.

The CPU difficulty scales from Easy to Medium to Hard
  - Easy difficulty see the CPU just randomly selecting moves
  - Medium difficulty has the CPU put a little more thought into its move selection, although there is a chance that it is random
  - Hard difficulty is the largest challenge and pushes you to a draw in most, if not all, situations
